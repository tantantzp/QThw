<h4>Education background</h4>
<p>Bachelor of Electronic Engineering, Northwest Institute of Telecommunication, Xi'an, China, 1982;</p>
<p>Master of Computer Network, Tohoku University, Japan, 1986;</p>
<p>Ph.D. in Computer Network, Tohoku University, Japan, 1989.</p>
 <h4>Social service</h4>
<p>Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council (ADCSC): Member, Deputy Secretary-General, and Director of the Office (2009-);</p>
<p>Advisory Committee of State Informationization Progress: Member (2003-);</p>
<p>China Computer Federation: Member of Ubiquitous/Pervasive Computing Technical Committee (2005-).</p>
<h4>Areas of Research Interests/ Research Projects</h4>
<p>Pervasive Computing</p>
<p>Operating System</p>
<p>Computer Network</p>
<h4>Research Status</h4>
<p>My major research areas include computer networking, operating systems, and ubiquitous/pervasive computing. I have led many national and international research projects and industrial projects. In recognition of my distinguished contributions, I won the National Scientific and Technological Progress Award (2nd class) twice in 1998 and 2001, National Technological Invention Award (2nd class) in 2004, as well as 5 provincial or ministerial awards. I also received the Prize of HLHL (Hong Kong) Foundation for Scientific and Technological Progress in 2005. I have filed 18 Chinese and 3 American patents as the first inventor, of which 17 Chinese and 1 American patents have been granted. Accordingly, I won the Top Patent Award of China in 2006. I have published over 180 technical papers on international journals and conferences, and I'm the author (or compiler) of 9 monographs or textbooks. I received IEEE Best Paper Award at the 21st IEEE AINA International Conference in 2007. I have made outstanding contributions to the engineering research and education of computing technology in China, in particular:</p>
<p>1. I have proposed and realized spatio-temporally extended von Neumann architecture-based thin clients, and have transferred this technology into real products, thus winning the National Technological Invention Award (2nd class) in 2004 and IEEE AINA 2007 Best Paper Award. To overcome the weakness (e.g., continuous upgrading, complicated operations, and low security) of traditional computers, I have started some research and implemented a new computing paradigm and platform based on pervasive computing, named Transparent Computing. This paradigm extends the von Neumann computer architecture to separate computation from storage of programs (including operating systems) spatiotemporally. The computation and storage of programs can be carried out by different machines connected by networks. In this way, users can select different operating systems (OSes) to run on the same hardware platform, thus solving the problem of running different big-size OSes and applications on small hardware platforms. These technologies have been transferred to Lenovo Beijing Corporation for real products, which are largely applied in many fields such as military, education, and business. Experts at CMU believed that this research is &quot;a very interesting innovation and may have significant implications for the design of future distributed systems&quot;.</p>
<p>2. I have put forward several protocol synthesis theories or methods, and achieved a number of innovations in fundamental network theory research. I developed the first network-access router in China with independent intellectual properties, which significantly promoted the theoretical research and industrial development of network in China. I proposed and realized an interactive protocol synthesis method that can predict and prevent logical errors. This method is published on various IEEE transactions, with relevant content selected into Computer Advancement-a book published by American Scientific Publishing House, and is also cited by people in the field as Zhang's Protocol Synthesis Method. The first access router in China, referred to as SED-08, had been successfully industrialized and had been widely deployed in military, government, and other critical departments such as schools and enterprises.</p>
<p>3. I have proposed and implemented an active service method that can provide services to meet the ever-changing demands of users. According to the innovative ideas of software development, I defined the concept, architecture, and implementation framework of active services, and proposed a series of methods for multi-faceted construction, transformation, discovery, reorganization, compilation, and evolution in building software component warehouse. Based on the above-mentioned principles, I designed and implemented the prototype, and applied them to military information systems. The monograph entitled &quot;Active Service: Concept, Architecture and Implementation&quot;, published by Chinese Science Press and Thomson Learning, was commented by Computer Journal of the United Kingdom as &quot;(it) breaks new ground in active services and program mining and is likely to be viewed in retrospect as a milestone in its field&quot;.</p>
